# QUEUE

Things noticed while doing something else. Per `CLAUDE.md` rule 1, they get
written down here instead of acted on.

Nothing here is approved work. It is a list of things a future session might
pick up, and half of it will turn out to be wrong.

---

## Debug affordances (blocks rule 3 and rule 6)

- ~~**No URL parameters.**~~ Done — `autoload/debug_entry.gd`. See `CLAUDE.md`
  rule 6 for the vocabulary.
- ~~**No on-screen debug HUD.**~~ Done — `ui/debug_hud.gd`. `?hud=1`, the DEV
  button, or F3. Shows fps / frame time / draw calls / memory (rule 9) and the
  campaign block, purse, stock and roster.

  Still thin: it reports frames but cannot **profile** them. If something is
  slow the HUD says so and not why.

## Known gaps

- **Finnish and Japanese are drafts.** Written to match register, not
  translated by a native speaker. Same caveat the `toko/` counter records for
  its own packs.
- **`godot/tools/export-web.sh` calls bare `python3`** for the font-subset
  check. On this machine that resolves to a Python without `fontTools`, so the
  export fails at the gate until `python3` is shadowed to the venv that has it.
  The script is right; the environment is not.
- **`.git` is 568MB** and will not shrink from the Piritori split — the art
  blobs are still in Suds-Jack's history. Only a full history rewrite of that
  repo would reclaim it, and that breaks every existing clone. Recorded as a
  decision not to.

## The stage (see COMBAT.md 3.1)

- **The projections do not match.** Location art is face-on; the board's axes
  are diagonal. Owner fork: turn the board, or build the stages corner-on.
  Nothing else about the battle's look matters as much.
- **`PLAY_AREA` is a port-side estimate living in `formation_battle.gd`.** It
  belongs in `art/v3/manifest.json` beside `portrait_safe_bounds`, as a
  `play_area` on each scene asset. The file says so itself.
- **Every crew member wears the same art.** Six identical figures in a 3v3 is
  the single loudest visual problem in the battle, louder than the grid. The
  pose sets exist per role; the battle is not picking distinct ones.
- **The approved courtyard cannot hold a bigger board.** Its floor is a wedge
  ending near 40% of frame height. A replacement needs a broad floor across the
  lower ~60%.

## Art

- **The pose sets are swapped, not played.** Nine poses per role exist and the
  battle picks one per state. There is no held-frame timing, no weight, no
  torn-edge sway — `ART_BIBLE.md` licenses all of it and none is used.
- **Courtyard and weather art remain visibly semi-approved** per
  `DESIGN_AUTHORITY.md`. They are in the build.
